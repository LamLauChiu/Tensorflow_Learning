https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/10779

For future reference: 
if you want to use the Python dmg installer, you also have to read Python 3's ReadMe 
and run the /Applications/Python 3.6/Install Certificates.command bash script to install newer certs.


If you want to just copy paste into Terminal:
/Applications/Python\ 3.6/Install\ Certificates.command
